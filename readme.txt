Yet Another Idle Shooter v0.1.0


Currently not working on it for now, intended to be a shoot-em-up with possibly some idle elements or maybe AI.


Controls:
Arrow keys: Move
Space bar: Shoot


Issues:
Shooting does not cooldown if spacebar is not held
Need to rework enemy movement and bullet spawning mechanic to something more intuitive/friendly
Need to add some sort of title screen


Changelog:
0.1.0:	Added version numbers
